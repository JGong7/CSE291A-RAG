Sprinkle with kosher salt.\nRoast in oven for 40-45 minutes.  Vegetables should be brown on edges and slightly softened.\nPour roasted vegetables into a saucepan and add 2 cans of chicken broth and fresh ground pepper to taste.\nOver medium high heat, heat vegetables and  broth until it bubbles.\nUsing an immersion blender (stick blender), thoroughly puree all contents of the saucepan.  If you don't have an immersion blender, you can use a regular blender.  Just be careful putting hot liquids in a blender as they can cause the lid to come flying off sending your yummy soup all over your kitchen.  (You can vent the lid a little to help reduce the chance of this happening.)",
