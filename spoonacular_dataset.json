    "instructions": "<ol><li>Preheat the oven to 325F (170C). Butter 6 individual ramekins or pyrex bowls.</li><li>Remove and set aside 2 Tbs of the sugar.</li><li>Separate the eggs: place the yolks in a large mixing bowl and the whites place in a separate bowl preferably plastic or metal.</li><li>Cream the butter with the rest of the sugar (1 cup less the 2 Tbs) until blended and fluffy.</li><li>Beat in the yolks, one at a time, beating after each addition until blended.</li><li>Beat in the vanilla and the lemon zest.</li><li>Add the flour and the salt and beat just until combined.</li><li>With the mixer on low, beat in the milk and the lemon juice. It will be very liquid.</li><li>In the separate bowl with very clean beaters, beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar until foamy and then until soft peaks form.</li><li>Continue beating the whites as you gradually add the 2 tablespoons sugar. Beat until stiff peaks form.</li><li>Fold the whites into the yolk/lemon batter just until incorporated and you have no more chunks of whites.</li><li>Using a ladle, fill the 6 ramekins with the batter almost to the top.</li><li>Place the filled ramekins in a large baking pan (placing a piece of newspaper on the bottom of the pan keeps the water of the water bath from boiling) and very carefully (so as not to get any water in the lemon batter) fill the pan with hot water, so that the water is halfway up the ramekins. If you like, place the baking pan in the oven and then pour in the water; this will avoid you having to lift and move the baking pan after it is filled and risk splashing the water into the batter.</li><li>Bake for 40  45 minutes. The tops will be puffed up, maybe  to 1 inch (1  2 cm) above the rim of the ramekins, and a deep golden brown.</li><li>Remove the baking pan from the oven then carefully remove the ramekins from the water bath onto a kitchen towel.</li><li>Allow to cool slightly before serving. Like a souffl, the tops will sink a bit when cooling.</li><li>Serve hot or warm  they can be eaten later but are best when fresh from the oven or just slightly cooled  with a sprinkling of powdered sugar or a dollop of whipped cream.</li></ol>",

Transfer them into a saucepan along with the prunes, broth, tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, molasses, garlic, pumpkin seeds, cumin, and oregano. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat and cook for 2 minutes; then lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes more.\nUsing an immersion blender, puree the mixture until completely smooth. Return to the heat and simmer, uncovered, for another 15 to 20 minutes. (If you dont have an immersion blender, carefully ladle the sauce into a food processor, and process until smooth, working in batches; then return to the pot.) Set the sauce aside until ready to serve with the corndogs, or if you are making this ahead of time, once the sauce has cooled, transfer it to a container and refrigerate.\nTo prepare the corn dogs:\nIn a mixing bowl, combine the masa harina, cornmeal,  cup of the rice flour, baking powder, brown sugar, and salt and mix to combine. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well to combine. Add the rice milk and lime juice and mix to combine. The mixture should resemble a thick pancake batter; if more milk is needed, add by the tablespoonful. Cover and refrigerate the mixture if you are not going to be frying right away.\nWhen you are ready to cook, heat the oil in a saucepan until it registers 350F on a deep-frying thermometer.

Cut each chicken sausage in half crosswise, to make eight pieces.\nRoll each piece of sausage in the rice flour to lightly coat. Thread the moistened bamboo skewers through the sausage pieces, so that the tips of the skewers are not quite poking out the top. Holding it by its skewer, dip a floured sausage piece into the batter, until it is completely coated. Carefully lift the stick and hold it over the bowl for a few seconds, allowing any excess batter to drip off. Repeat with another skewer. Carefully place two corn dogs into the hot oil and cook until they are crusty on the outside, and dark golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and keep warm. Repeat with each skewered sausage, allowing the oil to return to 350F in between. Serve immediately with the chili.",
