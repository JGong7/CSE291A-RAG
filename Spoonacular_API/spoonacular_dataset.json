Check the back of the shrimp and when you see the colour change about half way up, turn them over. Do the same on the other side. This should only take a minute to two minutes maximum on both sides  otherwise you will get a rubbery result if you leave it too long. Squeeze over the lime juice  this too should bubble and reduce. Add a little salt and pepper, stir through, remove from the heat and set aside.\n2.Mix the dressing ingredients together, check for flavour, adjust if need be and set aside.\n3.Place all the salad ingredients in a bowl except the avocado and the salt and pepper. Prepare the avocado as you are about to serve otherwise it will turn brown. Once it is covered in the lime dressing, this will slow down the oxidization process and it wont go brown so easily.\n4.When you are ready to serve mix  of the avocado through the salad and add the dressing. Toss everything together. Taste to see if you need any salt and pepper. Place your shrimp on top of the salad with the rest of the avocado and sprinkle/pour any residue from the pan over your salad in which you cooked the shrimp.

    ],
    "instructions": "I pull the leaves off two sprigs of rosemary and two sprigs of oregano (about a loose 1/2 cup of herbage).  I peel and mince 4 cloves of garlic.\nAlong with a few glugs of EVOO, some sea salt, and some cracked black pepper, I mix all this savory yumyum into a paste in a bowl.\nThen I spread it liberally along what will be the inside of my meat-wad.  See the strings laid out below?  Im going to fold this slab in half, encasing my herbaliciousness in the inside.\nSee?  I slide this baby into a ziplock bag and set it in the fridge to marinate for a few hours (overnight will work, too).  Its going to take at least 2 hours to roast, so I take it out around 4:00 pm\nAnd get my roasting pan set to high heat with a few glugs of EVOO shimmering on the surface.\nIm going to sear every surface of my luscious wrapped pink pig, which will help it cook through to tender later.  I leave the fat-cap for last.  Bottoms down!\nThen cut side, using tongs to flip when the surface has caramelized to a lovely golden brown.\nI even brown each tip, like so.\nFinally, I press the sweet sweet slice of quivering pork skin onto the searing hot oiled surface of my pan. After a few moments, I flip it the final time.\nThe house has already started to spell amazing, and the beautiful bacony aromas released once fat hits heat is almost more than I can handle.  Almost.  The promise of porcine perfection to come keeps me in check.\nOh, Ive nestled a few thick slices of white onion under my pork roast, because I dont want the bottom to oversear before the meat can release some juices, and then I dont want the bottom to stew in those juices too much.  The onion elevates the roast while adding flavor.  I wrap this in foil paper, and set into a\nOven.  It will bake for at least 2 hours; larger roasts will take longer, but for 2 people this is just the right size, and just the right amount of time to inhale the noxious tantalizing aromas before some sort of crazy sets in.\nI make my cucumber yoghurt right away, because I want the flavors to blend.  I start my peeling, then slicing\nThen chopping my cucumber.\nI throw it into a bowl, along with my yoghurt, 2 cloves of minced garlic, some lemon zest, the juice of 1/2 that lemon, some sea salt, cracked black pepper\nAnd I mix it all well.  I set this in the fridge, so all the flavors can come together.  Which they do oh, baby they do.\nWhen my roast is almost done (pretty much right at the 1:45 mark), I prep my spuds by splitting them into quarters, and tossing them with lots of EVOO, sea salt, cracked black pepper, and another 1/2 cup of chopped fresh rosemary and oregano.  Were bringing the scent and savory of the pork and potatoes together by lacing them both with the same herb blend.\nI spread these out on a sheet pan, and give them another healthy dose of EVOO, just to be sure theyre very heartily coated.  I set this into the bottom shelf of my oven, right above the heating element, so that my edges will crust up nicely. Youll see.\nWe purchased this lovely bottle of oregano scented white balsamic vinegar at O&Co. on Newbury Street.  Tonight was the perfect time to break it out.  Have you ever had french fries with vinegar?  If not, I highly recommend it.  This is the same concept.\nI had set aside the large bowl in which Id tossed my spuds; it was still coated with residual herbed EVOO, salt, and pepper.  Ive sliced my white onions into strips, and I toss them into this reservoir with another few healthy glugs of oil, and another handful of oregano leaves.  Heres where my vinegar comes in; I douse a healthy serving over this beautiful blend, stirring it all up very very well, soaking each each crisp slice of white root with dressing.  Every few minutes or so, I toss it afresh; this reactive base quick-pickles my onion slices transforming the flavor from pungent to perky sweet.\nFor the last 10 minutes of cooking my roast, I remove the foil from the top to expose the skin to the heat.  I can easily twist a wee bit of meat off with my fork, letting me know it is tender and perfectly ready to serve. I set the heat to 425, then stick my roast back in the oven so the skin can crisp.\nMeanwhile, my onions have pickled\nAnd Ive layered my baby spinach over them\nBefore I pour my spuds, sizzling oil and seared spices and all, over the whole pan.\nI toss this very well, letting the hot potatoes and oil wilt my spinach, and blending the pickled onions over the whole batch.\nMy pork is ready to go: the fat cap is crisped and blistered, and the meat is fork-tender.\nThis hunk of lovemeat almost slices itself, and the herbage cleavage is like a vein of precious green flavor gold.\nTopped with a cool cucumber cream, my thick, tender  slabs of herbed rolled pork roast with crispy, savory skin are perfectly partnered with my snappy spuds and buttery greens.  This is an elegant, delicious dinner that welcomes the first breezes of early spring  through freshly re-opened windows.  Light, fresh, and fantastic: I wish I could have you all over for dinner, because this was a company meal!",

    "instructions": "<ol><li>Crust: Using a stand mixer or handheld electric whisk, cream the butter, sugar and vanilla together until lightened. By hand, gently mix in the flour and almonds. Press the resulting crumbs into a 25cm loose-bottomed tin (or several smaller ones if you have decided to make individual servings).</li><li>Custard: Using a stand mixer or handheld electric whisk, cream together the cream cheese and sugar. Add the egg and vanilla and mix to completely combine. Pour into the prepared (uncooked) crust.</li><li>Apples: Slice the apples as thinly as possible - a mandoline is good for this. Toss gently in the sugar, cinnamon and lemon. Leave to soften for 10 minutes or so. Arrange in a layer on top of the custard. Start by laying overlapping apple slices all the way round the edge. Next create the 'rose' - arrange the slices in a spiral, standing the apple slices a little on their edge, until the centre hole is completely filled in. Save the smallest, thinnest pieces for the very centre as they will have to bend the most. Cover the tart with tin foil and bake in a preheated oven set at 190c for 30 minutes (this step helps soften the apples). Remove the foil and bake for 15-25 minutes longer, until the custard is puffed and the apple edges are lightly browned.</li><li>Glaze: When you take the tin foil off the apple tart, start making the glaze. Melt the sugar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until rich and golden. Add the butter and salt and stir to combine. Add the cream and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the ingredients have formed a smooth, unified caramel. When the tart looks nearly ready, remove it from the oven and brush with the glaze. Return to the oven and cook for a further few minutes until the glaze is gently bubbling. Cool to room temperature.  Can be kept in the fridge for several days - store in the baking tin and wrap well.</li></ol>",
